# Getting Started 

## What is Family Calendar? 
Family Calendar (famcal) has been developed as project for the IBAW Web Engineering module.
The goal of this application is to permit families to run a shared calendar (as the name suggests :) ) 

Every user has one family assiciated to. More users can be in the same family. 

Family Calendar appointments have tags and personas assigned to them.

The Family Calendar can run in an own docker environment or you can use the freely available shared version.
