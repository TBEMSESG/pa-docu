# Getting Started 

## What is Family Calendar? 
Family Calendar (famcal) has been developed as part of a Proget for the IBAW Web Engineering module.
The goal of this application is to permit families to run a shared calendar (as the name suggests :) ) 

Every user has one family assiciated to. More users can be in the same family. 

Family Calendar appointments have tags and personas assigned to them.
