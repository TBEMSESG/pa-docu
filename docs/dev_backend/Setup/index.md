## IBAW Web Engineering - Project 


### Description

This backend provides the needed API endpoints and DB connections for the "Family Calendar" application. 
See `Link` for the complete app. 

### Getting started

Finally, you will not need to run the backend as a standalone application because it will be integrated into a docker-compose environment and run together with the front end.

In case you need to test only the backend, feel free to 
**`git clone`** the repo and then run 
**`npm start`** 

Endpoints are listening on port **`3005`**

#### Env Variables need to run the Backend
